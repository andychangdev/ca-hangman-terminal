## üí° Purpose

- This terminal application showcases my ability to utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Python. It includes 4 features that demonstrate my understanding of variables, scope, loops, conditional control structures and error handling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

1. **Play Hangman**
    
    This feature allows the user to play Hangman. The game will generate a random hidden word for the user to guess. The user has a total of 7 lives to guess the hidden word.

2. **Select Wordlist**

    This feature allows the user to select a word list of their choice. Wordlists are categorised by difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.

3. **Modify Wordlist**

    This feature allows the user to modify wordlists. The user can select which word list to modify and then add or remove words from the selected word list. After modifying the word list, it will be saved for future use.

4.  **Create Wordlist**

    This feature allows the user to create their own wordlist. The user can add new or remove words to or from the wordlist. After creating their word list, they can name it and save it for future use.
